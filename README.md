How to calculate estimated APR, Debt ratio, and Liquidation price
Leveraged APR = Leveraged liquidity providing trading fee APY + Yield farming APR - Borrowing APY.
cappedDebtRatio  = 0.95
tokenMaxLeverage = borrowFactor / (borrowFactor - (collateralFactor * cappedDebtRatio))

totalAPY = ((farmingAPR + tradingFeeAPY) * tokenMaxLeverage) + (totalRewardAPY * (tokenMaxLeverage - 1)) - (tokenBorrowApy * (tokenMaxLeverage - 1))

Equations:

Rough equation to calculate leveraged Yield Farming returns without factoring in compounding, rewards, fees, etc:

E = L*P*(1 + r_e/n)^(n*t) - (L-1)*P*(1 + r_b/n)^(n*t)
where:

E: final equity
L: Leverage amount (1, or >2)
P: Initial principal
r_e: earning interest rate (such that 0.5=50%)
r_b: borrow interest rate (such that 0.5=50%)
n: number of times compounded a year, can assume daily (365.25).
t: number of years
This can be used as a comparison to this sim if you set all rates/fees to zero except trading fees, and no variation.
